# Testing Image Upload and Display

## Quick Test Steps

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Ensure environment variable is set:**
   - Check that `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is in your `.env.local`
   - Get token from Vercel Dashboard > Storage > Blob

3. **Test property creation with image:**
   - Navigate to admin dashboard
   - Go to Properties tab
   - Click "Add New Property"
   - Fill in all required fields
   - Select an image file (JPG, PNG, or GIF)
   - Submit the form

4. **Verify image display:**
   - Check that the property appears in the list
   - Verify the image is displayed on the property card
   - Image should load from Vercel Blob (not local path)

## Troubleshooting

If images aren't displaying:

1. **Check browser console for errors**
2. **Verify the property has primaryImage set:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   console.log(property.primaryImage);
   ```
3. **Check if URL is a blob URL:**
   - Should start with `https://` and contain `vercel-storage.com`
4. **Verify Blob token is working:**
   - Check server logs for upload errors

## Debug Information

The system now:

- ✅ Uses `getPropertyImageUrl()` for all image display
- ✅ Handles both Blob URLs and local paths
- ✅ Uploads images to Vercel Blob during property creation
- ✅ Sets both `primaryImage` and `images` array
- ✅ Has proper TypeScript typing
